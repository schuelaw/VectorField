# Vector Field Visualization

This visualization is pretty handy when teaching vector calculus. You can
use it to get an idea of the flux across a circle for different vector
fields. Students can try it with both conservative and non-conservative
fields to get a geometric sense that the net flux across a closed path is
zero.
